## Goal
- Display a working preview URL for your Next.js site so you can open it immediately.

## Steps
- Check the existing development server status and logs to confirm it’s running and identify the active port and URL.
- If the server is running, extract the preview URL (typically `http://localhost:3000`).
- Present the preview URL in the IDE for one-click opening.
- If the server is not running, start `npm run dev`, wait until the server is ready, then present the preview URL.

## Notes
- No code changes will be made.
- Only read-only status checks are used unless you approve starting the dev server.

Please confirm to proceed with checking the dev server and presenting the preview URL.
