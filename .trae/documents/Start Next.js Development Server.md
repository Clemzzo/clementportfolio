## Goal
- Start the local development server and provide a working preview URL.

## Steps
- Check whether a dev server is already running and identify the port and URLs.
- If not running, start `npm run dev` in the project root.
- Wait for readiness, capture the Local/Network preview URLs (typically `http://localhost:3000`).
- Present the preview URL for one-click open and verify no errors in logs.

## Notes
- No code changes are involved.
- I will only start or reuse the dev server after your confirmation.
